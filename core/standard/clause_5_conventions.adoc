== Conventions
This section provides details of conventions used in this document.

=== Identifiers

The normative provisions in this standard are denoted by the URI `http://www.opengis.net/spec/ogcapi-tiles-1/1.0` .

All requirements and conformance tests that appear in this document are denoted by partial URIs which are relative to this base.

=== Link relations

To express relationships between resources, https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc8288.txt[RFC 8288 (Web Linking)] is used.

The following https://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xhtml[IANA link relation types] are used in this Standard:

* **alternate**: Refers to a substitute for this context.

* **self**: Conveys an identifier for the link’s context.

* **item**: The target IRI points to a resource that is a member of the collection represented by the context IRI.

* **service-desc**: Identifies a service description for the context that is primarily intended for consumption by machines. (Web API definitions are considered service descriptions)

* **service-doc**: Identifies service documentation for the context that is primarily intended for human consumption.

The following link relation types specified in the _Two Dimensional Tile Matrix Set and Tileset Metadata_ Standard are used:

* **http://www.opengis.net/def/rel/ogc/1.0/tiling-scheme**: The target IRI points to a resource that describes the TileMatrixSet according to the 2D-TMS standard.

* **http://www.opengis.net/def/rel/ogc/1.0/dataset**: The target IRI points to a resource representing the dataset (e.g., the root of an OGC Web API).

* **http://www.opengis.net/def/rel/ogc/1.0/geodata**: The target IRI points to a resource representing a collection of geospatial data.

In addition, the following link relation types are used for which no applicable IANA-registered link relation type could be identified:

* **http://www.opengis.net/def/rel/ogc/1.0/tilesets-vector**: The target IRI points to a resource that describes how to provide tile sets of the context resource in vector format.

* **http://www.opengis.net/def/rel/ogc/1.0/tilesets-map**: The target IRI points to a resource that describes how to provide tile sets of the context resource in map format.

* **http://www.opengis.net/def/rel/ogc/1.0/tilesets-coverage**: The target IRI points to a resource that describes how to provide tile sets of the context resource in coverage format.

* **http://www.opengis.net/def/rel/ogc/1.0/tiling-schemes**: The target IRI points to a resource that lists one or more TileMatrixSets according to the 2D-TMS standard.


Used in combination with _OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core_ or _OGC API - Common - Part 1: Core_, other link relation types will be used, including:

* **http://www.opengis.net/def/rel/ogc/1.0/conformance**: Refers to a resource that identifies the specifications that the link's context conforms to.

Used in combination with _OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core_ or _OGC API - Common - Part 2: Geospatial Data_, other link relation types will be used, including:

* **http://www.opengis.net/def/rel/ogc/1.0/data**: Refers to the list of collections available for a dataset.

Each resource representation includes an array of links. Implementations are free to add additional links for all resources provided by the Web API.

=== Use of HTTPS

For simplicity, this Standard in general only refers to the HTTP protocol. This is not meant to exclude the use of HTTPS and simply is a shorthand notation for "HTTP or HTTPS." In fact, most servers are expected to use https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2818[HTTPS], not https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt[HTTP].
