^|A |Every 200-response of the server with the media type application/geo+json SHALL be a GeoJSON document representing only one tile.
^|B | The root of the GeoJSON document SHALL be

* a GeoJSON FeatureCollection Object for features, or
* a GeoJSON Feature Object for a single feature.
^|C | Regardless of the TileMatrixSet CRS, the geometry coordinates SHALL be in CRS84 as stated in the GeoJSON standard unless a _prior arrangement_ applies to use an alternative coordinate reference system. The fact that a TileMatrixSet is used does not constitute a _prior arrangement_. For example, an extension could negotiate another CRS for coordinates with a query parameter.
