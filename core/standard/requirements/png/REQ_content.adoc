NOTE: The way colors in a PNG image are mapped to geospatial features or coverage values is out of scope of this Standard. However, a common set of portrayal rules for all tiles representing part of the same resource is essential, as adjacent tiles are normally represented one next to the other and presented as a single image to the user.
