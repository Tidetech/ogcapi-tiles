identifier:: /req/jpeg/content
part:: Every 200-response of the server with the media type image/jpeg SHALL be a JPEG document representing only one tile
part:: The colors of the JPEG SHALL represent coverage values in the tile.
part:: All tiles representing parts of the same resource or resources and using the same style SHALL follow the same portrayal rules
====

NOTE: The way the colors in a JPEG image are mapped to geospatial features or coverage values is out of scope of this standard. However, a common set of portrayal rules for all tiles representing part of the same resource is essential, as adjacent tiles are normally represented one next to the other and presented as a single image to the user.

NOTE: The use of JPEG to represent linear features or color solid polygons is not recommended.
