== Scope
The _OGC API â€” Tiles_ Standard specifies the behavior of Web APIs that provide access to tiles of one or more geospatial data resources (collections) that the Web API offers. This Standard defines how to discover which resources offered by the Web API can be retrieved as tiles, get metadata about the available tile sets (including according to which tile matrix set each tile set is partitioned and the limits of that tile set within a common potentially global tile matrix set) and how to request a tile. This Standard is sometimes referred as _Tiles API_.

The core conformance class is defined in a way that could be easily included in a web API, even if that API does not conform to the _OGC API - Common_ standard. A web API can combine some requirements classes of this OGC API Standard with those of other OGC API Standards (including _OGC API - Common_) to extend the scope of the Web API by adding functionality.
