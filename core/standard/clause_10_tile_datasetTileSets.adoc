== Requirements Class "Dataset Tilesets"

=== Overview

[[tiles-dataset-tiles-overview]]

include::requirements/requirements_class_dataset-tilesets.adoc[]

The Dataset Tilesets Requirements Class defines a mechanism to retrieve a list of tilesets for a dataset (a.k.a., a root resource) which may contain multiple geospatial data resources. This Class is used in conjunction with the Requirements Class "Tilesets List" (<<rc_tileSets-list>>) that specifies the response to this GET request.

Combined with the Requirements Class "Collections Selection" (<<rc_collections-selection>>), selecting specific geospatial data resources (collections) to be combined and retrieved as tiles is possible. For retrieving the list of tilesets for only one collection, the Requirements Class "Geodata Tilesets" (<<rc_geoDataResourceTileSets>>) can also be used if it is implemented.

If an OGC based Web API offers several geospatial data resources for a dataset, that API may limit the number of collections that can be retrieved together, and/or provide a limited subset of the collections by default.

=== General
This Requirements Class describes how to serve tilesets for a dataset provided as Web API instance implementing  _OGC API - Common - Part 1_ requirement classes or https://docs.ogc.org/is/17-069r4/17-069r4.html[OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core, version 1.0] as an alternative.

=== Web API Landing Page

The landing page provides links to start exploring the resources offered by the Web API. The landing page mainly consists of a list of links to root resources. This Requirements Class requires including in the landing page one or more link(s) to list(s) of tilesets available for the dataset.

==== Response

include::requirements/dataset-tilesets/REQ_landingpage.adoc[]

In the landing page, in JSON format, the links follow the link schema defined in the _OGC API - Common - Part 1: Core_ or in _OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core_ 1.0.
Below you find an example fragment of the response to an _OGC API - Tiles_ landing page showing links to dataset tilesets.

=== Dataset tilesets
The dataset tilesets operation provides essential tileset metadata and links to tilesets resources that support requesting tiles from the dataset.

==== Operation

include::requirements/dataset-tilesets/REQ_operation.adoc[]

The request of this operation has no parameters.

==== Response
A successful response to a dataset tilesets list request is a list of tilesets as defined by the Requirements Class "Tileset List" (<<rc_tileSets-list>>) and the Requirements Class "Tileset" (<<rc_tileSet>>).

=== Tiles
The Requirements Class "Core" (<<rc_tiles_core>>) defines how to retrieve a single tile from a tileset available for the dataset.

==== Response
The response is expected to represent the entire dataset.
In a Web API based server providing access to a complex dataset formed by several geospatial data resources, it can be useful to select specific sub-resources of interest when requesting data from this dataset.
This can be achieved with the use of the Requirements Class "Collections Selection" (<<rc_collections-selection>>) or as an automatic decision by the server.
