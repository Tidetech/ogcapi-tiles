=== Introduction
The _OGC API — Tiles_ Standard defines building blocks that can be used in the implementation of Web API based servers and compatible clients to support the retrieval of tiled geospatial data that follow the structure defined in the https://docs.ogc.org/is/17-083r4/17-083r4.html[OGC Two Dimensional Tile Matrix Set and Tile Set Metadata 2.0] standard (OGC 17-083r4) (see <<rc_tiles_core>>), which is also known as the 2D TMS standard. This Standard assumes that the reader is familiar with the concepts in the OGC 17-083r4 This Standard, such as a tile, tile set, tile set metadata, tile matrix and tile matrix set. If that is not the case, reading the OGC 17-083r4 overview subsection is recommended.

Services and clients are encouraged to support as many of the TileMatrixSets defined in Annex D and E of the OGC 17-083r4 Standard as possible. Other TileMatrixSets defined in the http://www.opengis.net/def/tms[OGC TileMatrixSet register] for all geospatial data resources to maximize interoperability should be considered. However, support for any specific TileMatrixSet is not required. Tiles that share the same TileMatrixSet definition can be easily visualized together in a data integration client.

The OGC API - Tiles standard is an alternative to the OGC Web Map Tile Service (WMTS) standard <<OGC07-057r7>>. The fundamental concept TileMatrixSet has not changed from the one used in WMTS. Therefore tiles provided via a WMTS instance and the ones generated by an _OGC API — Tiles_ implementation instance that are based on the same TileMatrixSet can also be easily visualized and/or processed together. If the selected tile matrix set is the one called WebMercatorQuad (see OGC 17-083r4 Annex D.1), tiles are also compatible with the ones made available by some popular mass market approaches.

This Standard does not specify any requirement for the type of _geospatial data resource_ that could be delivered as tiles.
Provided that the geospatial data resources can be organized into tiles, any such resource can be supported regardless of whether they are maps, features data,
coverages, a resource that does not represent data per se (e.g., an annotation) and so forth.

NOTE: The geospatial data resources (e.g., collections) replace the concept of layer in the OGC Web Map Service (WMS) <<OGC06-042>> and WMTS Standards.
The concept of collections allows to provide multiple access mechanisms defined in complementary OGC API Standards, such as tiles and features, to the same collection of data (through different geospatial resource aspects).
Geospatial data resources can advertise one or more lists of available tilesets (see <<rc_tileSet>> and <<rc_tileSets-list>>).
This Standard also defines how to link to tilesets originating from two specific data resources:
OGC API datasets (see <<rc_datasetTileSets>>) and collections (see <<rc_geoDataResourceTileSets>>). However, other OGC APIs can provide other access and linking possibilities.
Accessing the _geospatial data resource_ content (other than as tiles) or its descriptions is possible but out of the scope of this Standard.
If a description of the _geospatial data resource_ is specified by another Standard, and this description has a mechanism to add links to other resources, this Standard indicates the need to add a link to the list of available tilesets.

The _OGC API - Tiles_ standard does not specify how to get a Web API definition, the conformance class list or the collections lists.
However, the standard assumes that the first two are defined by an OGC API standard (e.g., _OGC API - Common - Part 1: Core_ or _OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core_ Standards) and the latter by an
OGC API for collections (e.g., _OGC API - Common - Part 2: Geospatial data_ or the _OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core_ Standards).

=== Evolution from OGC Web Services

OGC Web Service (OWS) standards have historically implemented a Remote-Procedure-Call-over-HTTP architectural style using Extensible Markup Language (XML) for payloads. This was the state-of-the-art in the late 1990s and early 2000s when some of the initial versions of OGC Web Services Standards were originally designed and documented. Their service oriented architectural style has now a competing resource Web API style. The WMTS 1.0 standard defines a resource oriented architectural style but lacks a Web API definition. The _OGC API - Tiles_ Standard specifies a Web API that follows the Web architecture and in particular the W3C/OGC Best Practices for sharing Spatial Data on the Web <<w3cogc_sdw>> as well as the W3C Best Practices for sharing Data on the Web <<w3c_dw>>. The bibliography lists several OGC Engineering Reports from initiatives that led to the development of OGC API — Tiles. Some of the Engineering Reports are from OGC Testbed initiatives <<OGC17-041>> <<OGC19-069>> , whereas others are from the OGC Vector Tiles Pilot <<OGC18-086r1>>  <<OGC19-082r1>>  <<OGC18-078>>  <<OGC18-083>>  <<OGC18-101>>.

This Standard defines the necessary elements to incorporate tile support into a Web API implementation. These elements can be incorporated in an API based on the _OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core_ or can be incorporated in a Web API implementation based on the _OGC API - Common - Part 1: Core_. Both of those Standards specify a kernel of a Web API approach to services that follows current resource-oriented architecture practices in the OGC. OGC API - Common provides the foundation upon which implementations of the OGC API Standards can be built. OGC API - Common can be integrated with this Standard and other resource-specific OGC API standards to build an Web API implementation. However, this Standard is also designed in a way that can extend OGC API - Common, but does not make OGC API - Common mandatory. As such this Standard can be reused as a building block in other APIs that do not follow the OGC API pattern.

Beside the general alignment with the architecture of the Web (e.g., consistency with HTTP/HTTPS, hypermedia controls), another goal for the suite of OGC API Standards is modularization. This goal has several facets:

* Clear separation between core requirements and more advanced capabilities. This _OGC API - Tiles - Part 1: Core_ Standard defines the requirements that are relevant for anyone who wants to share or use Tiled Data at a fine-grained level. Additional capabilities that several communities are using today will be specified as extensions to this Standard.
* Technologies that change more frequently are decoupled and specified in separate modules ("requirements classes" in OGC terminology). This enables, for example, the use/re-use of new encodings for spatial data or Web API definition (such as a new version of the OpenAPI description document).
* Modularization is not just about a single "service". OGC APIs provide building blocks that can be reused in Web APIs in general. In other words, a server supporting OGC API - Tiles Requirements should not be seen as a standalone service. Rather, the web API implementation  should be viewed as a collection of Web API building blocks which together implement Tile capabilities. A corollary for this is that it should be possible to implement a Web API that concurrently conforms to conformance classes from the Features, Coverages, Maps, Tiles, and other future OGC API standards.

The OGC APIs approach is intended  to support two types of client developers:

* Those that have never heard about the OGC. Developers should be able to create a client using the Web API definition without the need to adopt a specific OGC approach (they no longer need to read how to implement a GetCapabilities response document, allowing them to focus on the geospatial resource aspects).
* Those that want to write a "generic" client that can access OGC APIs. In other words, they are not specific to a particular Web API.

As a result of following a RESTful approach, implementations of an OGC API is not backwards compatible with OWS implementations per se. However, a design goal is to define OGC APIs in a way that an OGC API interface can be mapped to or used as a façade to an existing OWS implementation (where appropriate). OGC APIs are intended to be simpler and more modern, but still an evolution from the previous versions and their implementations making the transition easy such as by initially implementing facades in front of the current OWS services.

=== Relationship to other OGC API standards

The OGC WMS and WMTS standards share the concept of a map and the capability to create and distribute maps at a limited resolution and size.
In WMS, the number of rows and columns that a map should have can be selected by the user within limits. In WMTS the number of rows and columns of the tile is predefined in the tile matrix.

Over time, in the OGC, the concept of a tile, initially used for _map tiles_ has been generalized to other data models such as feature data (some vendors use the expression _vector tiles_)
and even to coverage data or processes that can be parallelized dividing space into tiles.
The _OGC API - Tiles_ Standard presents an approach to tiles that can be applied to almost any resource type that returns geospatial data. If implemented in conjunction with the _OGC API - Features_ Standard and designed to access a feature collection, the expected result is tiled feature data. If implemented in conjunction with the _OGC API - Maps_ candidate standard and designed to access a collection that is transformed into a map by applying a style,
the result should be map tiles (usually in PNG or JPEG format).

The _OGC API - Tiles_ Standard can be referenced by other OGC Standards that provide resources that can be offered as tiles. For example:

* The _OGC API - Maps_ candidate standard specifies the link relation types to access map tilesets from a dataset or collection.
* The _OGC API - Styles_ candidate standard defines paths to list available styles from which tilesets can also be accessed.
* The _OGC API - Coverages_ candidate standard specifies the link relation types and specifics of retrieving coverage tiles.
* The _OGC API - Processes - Part 3: Workflows and Chaining_ candidate standard provides a mechanism to trigger localized processing workflows as a result of retrieving tiles (for a specific area and resolution of interest).

This document is the first part of a series of _OGC API - Tiles_ "parts" that use the core and extensions model.
Future parts might specify other extensions, such as how to retrieve multiple tiles in a single request.
Other standards or extensions of standards may also provide mechanisms (e.g., additional query parameters) to deal with additional dimensions such as elevation, or more advanced temporal capabilities than what is defined in this standard's _datetime_ conformance class.

=== Using this standard independently

Although the _OGC API — Tiles_ Standard is designed as a building block that can be leveraged by (or with) other OGC API Standards adding precisions about specific types of data available as tiles
(e.g., _OGC API - Features_ standard, and _OGC API - Maps_ and _OGC API - Coverages_ candidate standards), the conformance classes defined in this Standard are still concrete enough to make it possible to support distributing and requesting various types of tiled data, including coverages, vector features and maps, by relying strictly on the content herein and in the
https://docs.ogc.org/is/17-083r4/17-083r4.html[OGC Two Dimensional Tile Matrix Set and Tile Set Metadata 2.0] standard.

As informative guidance implementations should consider the following aspects.

==== Description of the domain

Three different mechanisms are defined by this Standard to describe the domain of the dimensions of the tiles, including spatiotemporal axes as well as additional dimensions.

In the Requirements Class "Tilesets List" (<<rc_tileSets-list>>), the collection description inherited from _OGC API - Common - Part 2_ contains an `extent` property that can
describe both the spatial and temporal domain of the data. In addition, the _Unified Additional Dimensions_ common building block, used in the
example OpenAPI definition, further specifies that additional dimensions shall be described in a similar way to the temporal dimension.
An extra `grid` property in the example OpenAPI definition also allows specifying the resolution and the number of cells (for data organized as a regular grid) or
a list of coordinates (for data organized as an irregular grid) along each dimension.

With the _TileSet_ conformance class, the tile set metadata allows to specify a spatial bounding box for tiles as a whole, as well as for each individual
collection of geospatial data represented or contained within the tiles (the _layers_). The resolution of these layers can also be specified by including
the minimum and maximum cell size and equivalent scale denominators. The informative Annex J of the https://docs.ogc.org/is/17-083r4/17-083r4.html[OGC Two Dimensional Tile Matrix Set and Tile Set Metadata 2.0] standard
further extends this capability to describe the domain set by enhancing the schema to include bounds and resolution for additional dimensions as well being able to handle the specifics of unequal temporal units. The Annex J also includes provisions to describe tile matrix sets featuring additional dimensions which not only
extend in other dimensions but can also define divisions and down sampling of these additional dimensions for lower resolution tile matrices.

In addition to describing the bounds of the tileset dimensions, the Requirements Class "TileSet" (<<rc_tileSet>>) also supports specifying limits in terms of identifiers for the minimum and maximum tile matrices, tile rows, and tile columns for which data is available.

==== Description of the observed or measured properties

The Requirements Class "TileSet" (<<rc_tileSet>>), supports specifying the tile set metadata for the measured or observed properties for each
collection of geospatial data represented or contained within the tiles (the _layers_). For each of these properties, a JSON schema and semantic information
can be described. This schema can be used to describe properties for feature collections or the range type of coverages.

==== Available formats and tile response expectations

The Tiles API Standard in Requirements classes for tile encodings (<<rc_data_encodings>>) defines six requirements classes for specific encodings for different types of tiled data.
Additional encodings can be supported using HTTP content negotiation, following conventions specific to those encodings. In this case requirements are expected to fall back to the closest
encoding defined in Requirements classes for tile encodings (<<rc_data_encodings>>) (e.g., using the GeoTIFF and netCDF conformance class as a model for other coverage data, the JPEG and PNG classes
for other map tiles encodings, and the Mapbox Vector Tiles or GeoJSON for other vector tiles encodings).
The informative Annex J of the https://docs.ogc.org/is/17-083r4/17-083r4.html[OGC Two Dimensional Tile Matrix Set and Tile Set Metadata 2.0] Standard also describes a mechanism that can be used to deliver and access 3D content
using this standard, including 3D models either batched as a single mesh, or as points vector tiles referencing shared 3D models.

==== Limitations

Although implementations of the _OGC API — Tiles_ Standard can be used "stand-alone", other OGC API Standards or draft specifications may provide additional capabilities and specify additional normative requirements describing how to retrieve specific types of tiled content. This includes describing in greater detail the domain or the observed or measured properties within the tiled data. Conforming to these standards as well may enable greater interoperability. For example, for map tiles, this Standard does not define how a client requests a specific background color or whether tiles should be opaque or transparent expecting that the _OGC API — Maps_ will do so.

=== How to approach an implementation of an OGC API Standard

There are at least two ways to approach an implementation of an OGC API Standard.

* Read the landing page, look for links, follow them and discover new links until the desired resource is found
* Read a Web API definition document that specifies a list of paths and path templates to resources.

For the first approach, many resources in the _OGC Web APIs_ include links with _rel_ properties to know the reason and purpose for this relation. The following figure illustrates the resources as ellipses and the links as arrows with the link _rel_ as a label.

[#img_relMapTiles,reftext='{figure-caption} {counter:figure-num}']
.Resources and relations to them via links
image::images/relMapTiles.png[width=800,align="center"]

For the second approach, implementations should consider Requirements Class "OpenAPI Specification 3.0" (<<rc_oas30_definition>>) which specifies the use of _operationID_ suffixes, providing a mechanism to associate API paths with the requirements class that they implement.

There is yet a third way to approach an implementation of an OGC API Standard that relies on assuming a set of predefined paths and path templates.
These predefined paths are used in many examples in this Standard and are presented together in <<table_resources>>.
Many implementations of this Standard will provide a Web API definition document (e.g. OpenAPI) using this set of predefined paths and path templates to get necessary resources directly.
All this could mislead the reader into getting the false impression that the predefined paths are enforced. They are not. 
Therefore, building a client that is assuming a predefined set of paths is risky.
Even so, many API implementations will actually follow the predefined set of paths and the client using this approach could be successful on many occasions.
Again, be aware that these paths are not required by this Standard.

NOTE: Despite the fact that full path and full path templates in the previous table are used in many implementations of the _OGC API — Tiles_ Standard, these exact paths are ONLY examples and are NOT required by this Standard. Other paths are possible if correctly described in by the Web API definition document and/or the links between resources. However, the _TileSets list_ conformance class does require that paths listing tilesets end with `.../tiles`.

NOTE: The use of a `{tileMatrixSetId}` URI template variable is not required by this Standard. However, the <<per_core_tc-tilematrixset-definition,_TileMatrixSet definition_ permission>> proposes to make all tileset paths homogeneous by using it. A `{tileMatrixSetId}` template variable must NOT be used in templated links of the tileset metadata as defined in Requirements Class "TileSet" (<<rc_tileSet>>).

=== Why we call them "tiles"
The word _tile_ is traditionally used to refer to a thin, flat or convex slab of hard material such as baked clay or plastic, laid in rows to cover walls, floors, and roofs. In this Standard, the same approach is used to cover the viewport of a computer screen with tiles representing parts of the world (geospatial features). Actually some examples of traditional tilesets representing geospatial features can also be found. They are tilesets with only one available tilematrix.
